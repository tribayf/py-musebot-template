# Musebot Template for Python

_**Note: Template tested under macOS 10.12.6, Python 3.6, and Pyo 0.8.9**_

A template for creating [Musebots](http://musicalmetacreation.org/musebots/) in Python, using [Pyo](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/) for synthesis and OSC communication.

## Template Dependencies

- Python 3.6
- Pyo 0.8.9
- wxPython 4.0

## Installation

1. Install Pyo via the installer located [here](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/) [Recommended]. If you are apt to compile from source, instructions can be found [here](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/pyodoc/compiling.html).

   Users running macOS you will probably get an alert saying that Pyo is from an unidentified developer. Open the Security & Privacy tab in System Preferences and click the `Open Anyway` button to proceed with the installation.

2. Pyo will be installed system-wide and you can now import it into any Python 3 project.

## Using the Template

0. Learn about working with Musebots by checking out the info links below
1. Copy the template directory into your `Musebots` directory and rename it what you wish to call your new Musebot (e.g. `tb_noisebot`). Prefixing the name with your initials to distinguish it from other people's Musebots is generally a good idea ðŸ˜Š
2. Open the `config.txt` file and change `id <name>` in the first line so that `<name>` matches the name you just gave to parent directory (e.g. `id tb_noisebot`)
3. Define your Musebot in `musebot.py`
